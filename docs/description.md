CSCI S-89B INTRODUCTION TO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
FINAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Final Project Description:
Each student must select a topic related to Natural Language Processing from the list of available topics. Alternatively, students can suggest their own topic. The final project must meet the requirements outlined below to demonstrate the selected technology or use case.

Please note that the final project is an individual effort. If you want to work in teams, you need to get approval from the instructor. Please keep in mind that the expectations are higher for group projects, and not every group proposal will be approved.

The purpose of the final project is for us to learn practical applications of Natural Language Processing models. Please write your final project report as a tutorial or learning tool. All project materials, including all code, will be made available to the class. Please do not include any proprietary code or code you do not want to become public. Working code is required - no working code means no grade. Please develop your projects using the R’s STM or Keras/TensorFlow APIs.

Please keep in mind that teaching staff does not provide guidance on implementing your final project. You must do the research yourself. Once you sign up for a topic, that topic belongs to you. Your project must demonstrate a Natural Language Processing related method or use case and include a software demonstration. Your project must include a visualization component to present a graphical representation of the results. This project is not a research paper but rather a technology demonstration and tutorial.


Final Project Requirements:
1.	Define a problem statement that describes what problem you will solve using the selected technology.
2.	Select a data source. There are many data sets available online.
3.	Develop and code a solution for the specified problem using the selected data source and technology, using R’s STM or Keras/TensorFlow APIs.
4.	Produce a visualization of your data/results
 

Documentation Requirements:
1)	Demo/solution implementation and working code: 
Produce a single working demo that meets the problem statement and provides a full implementation of the solution. Provide neatly organized and complete working code with comments. Note that a project will not receive any points if a working implementation/code is missing. Please provide the URL to your full data source. If your data set is larger than 10MB, do not upload your full data set to Canvas. In such a case, please provide only a sample of your data with the rest of your submission.
2)	Slides: 
Produce a set of 10-20 PowerPoint slides with a few snapshots from your demo that capture the key points: your problem statement, what the technology does, your demonstration, and pros/cons. The first slide of your PowerPoint presentation must follow the standard format that we provide. Please use a white background for all slides. White backgrounds make slides more readable and printable. Include the URLs of your video presentation on the last slide. This can be a YouTube link or any other video platform, such as a Zoom recording. Note: The filename should start with the topic name followed by your name.
3)	Report:
Produce a detailed document completely describing the analyzed technology or use case, including all installation and configuration steps. Your report should start with your name and project title. Detailed documentation of installations and configurations is required. Your colleagues must be able to reproduce your work by solely following the steps you have documented. Describe the problem statement, data set, installation/configuration process, results, what worked and what did not work and why, and any lessons learned. The report must show all steps needed to reproduce the examples you developed.
a)	The first page of your report should contain your name, the project title, and a one-page summary (abstract). 
b)	Please include page numbers. 
c)	You submit the document in doc, docx, or pdf format. However, submitting only a Jupyter notebook is not acceptable.
d)	Please include a link to your 7-15 min video presentation.


4)	YouTube presentation: 
Produce a 7-15 minute video presentation. This video should provide a summary of the technology as well as details about your project, its results, and your findings. You may use any suitable platform to record and share your video, such as Zoom or YouTube.

Submission Instructions: 
Please upload the report and slides separately. Also, upload a zip file that contains your software and data files (up to 10 MB).
Grading Criteria:
Final Project Selection:					2 points
Project Report and practical software code example: 	7 points
PowerPoint Slides:						3 points
7-15 minute video presentation:				3 points
